## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

As electric vehicles continue to reshape the automotive industry, understanding their adoption patterns, model distribution, and geographical spread is crucial for stakeholders, including manufacturers, policymakers, and researchers. This project provides insights into:

- Growth of electric vehicles over time  
- Comparison between BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle)  
- Popular models and manufacturers  
- State-wise distribution of EVs  
- CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility

## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics Analyzed (KPIs)

1. **Total Vehicles** â€“ Understand the complete landscape of EV registrations  
2. **Average Electric Range** â€“ Gauge advancements in battery technology  
3. **Total BEV Vehicles & %** â€“ Identify the market share of pure electric vehicles  
4. **Total PHEV Vehicles & %** â€“ Understand the share of plug-in hybrid vehicles
